# The Secret Code
My Suggestion is that we start by masking the tiled image with the secret
text/code and then with the remaining tiles shuffle those.  the correct jigsaw
will state the code with its tiling when complete.

# Common
 - periodic tiling's (squares, triangles, hexagons)
 - aperidic tiling
 - image api handler, (get all those lovely pictures from pexels?)
 
# Server?
 - for multiplayer
